This folder contains the render images of my models to be used in the tv show intro.
All renders are made in blender 3.0.

First model - **Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 1967**

Being traced using a reference image. An external blueprint of the Mustang is being used. The car has been given a metallic material to look more realistic.
The car is also modelled with body detailing to look different from the other car. Two spotlights are used to give the headlights effect, while the tailights coloring is set to 'emission' to look realistic. A light source is added on top of the car to give good lighting.


Second Model - **Aston Martin V8 1978**

Being traced using a reference image. An external blueprint of the Aston Martin is being used. The car has been given a metallic material to look more realistic.

Third Model - **Race Flag**

A race flag is created. The flag is made using a cloth material to make it flow. A wind force field is added to give the flag a flowing effect.

Fourth Model - **Traffic Lights Signal**
